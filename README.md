Little HTML project I worked on for school

Hello,

My project opens by the page "login.html" for a better experience. Please pay attention to some important points of the project:

 - On the login page the functions: "Remember me" and "Forgot your password?" have no interaction with the code and are
merely illustrative;

 - To play the audios on the home page you have to click on the images;

 - The Project started to be developed in Firefox browser but for technical reasons at the last minute it moved to Chrome which led to a de-formatting of the
the audio controls lost their style (you can still find it in the CSS page "mainStyle.css" if you want to check it);

 - The reason for this change is because Firefox does not allow the use of the JavaScript function localStorage unlike Chrome;

 - Date of birth is collected and stored in the survey even though it is never used (possible implementations in future projects);
